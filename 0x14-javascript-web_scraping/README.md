## Introduction

Working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data is fundamental in web development and data exchange. JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write, making it an excellent choice for APIs, configuration files, and more. In this repository, we explore how to work with JSON data effectively.

## Accessing JSON Data

One of the key skills you'll learn is how to access the attributes of a simply-created JSON object. We'll follow a workflow that allows you to extract specific information from a JSON structure. Understanding how to navigate and manipulate JSON data is crucial for tasks such as data retrieval from APIs and data storage.

## The Request Module

The request module is a powerful tool for making HTTP requests in JavaScript. It simplifies the process of sending HTTP GET and POST requests, making it a valuable tool for web scraping, API interactions, and data retrieval. You'll learn how to use the request module to fetch data from external sources.

## Modern JavaScript

Modern JavaScript is the foundation for efficient and clean code. We'll explore modern JavaScript practices and techniques to ensure that your code is maintainable and up-to-date with industry standards. This includes best practices, ES6 features, and more.
